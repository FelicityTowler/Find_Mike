## What is Find Mike?

**Find Mike** is a web application that brings two user groups together: comedians seeking stage time at open mic events, and event managers seeking comedians to perform at said events.

It is a booking platform with the aim of becoming the one and only place to book comedy open mic stage time in the UK; allowing performers to easily book upcoming events, manage their upcoming bookings, and review venues; and event managers to list their events and manage who is booked to perform at them.

Presently, comedians have to find and book open mic stage time through an event's own platform or unique booking proccess. With ambitious amateur comedians looking to perform at open mic events multiple times a week, keeping track of each of these booking proccess and bookings can take up much of their time and rescources. 

Can *you* imagine making a room full of people laugh after a day of admin? 

If you can, good on ya, you're one of the lucky few.

If you can't....welcome to **Find Mike**.
