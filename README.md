## 1.1. What is Find Mike?

**Find Mike** is a web application that brings two user groups together: comedians seeking stage time at open mic events, and event managers seeking comedians to perform at said events.

It is a booking platform with the aim of becoming the one and only place to book comedy open mic stage time in the UK; allowing performers to easily book upcoming events, manage their upcoming bookings, and review venues; and for event managers to list their events and manage who is booked to perform at them.

Presently, comedians have to find and book open mic stage time through an event's own platform or unique booking proccess. With ambitious amateur comedians looking to perform at open mic events multiple times a week, keeping track of each of these booking proccesses and bookings can take up much of their time and rescources. 

Can *you* imagine making a room full of people laugh after a day of admin? 

If you can, good on ya, you're one of the lucky few.

If you can't....welcome to **Find Mike**.


## 1.2. How to use Find Mike

![Find your next gig](app/assets/images/NextGig.PNG)

### 1.2.1. As a comedian

#### 1.2.1.1. Searching for an event
As a comedian, you can simply select a date that you'd like to perform on, click on the search icon, and be taken to a page diaplaying all open mic events added to the website on that date. 

#### 1.2.1.2. Requesting a spot at an event
You can view information on each event and make your decision as to whether you'd like to perform there. If the event has availability you can book a spot. That booking will then show up under your *Pending* bookings on your *My bookings* page in your account.

The event manager (the person who created the event on Find Mike) will then decide to approve or decline your request. If approved the booking will appear under *Approved* on your *My bookings* page.

#### 1.2.1.3. Cancelling a spot at an event
You are able to cancel your place at any event you have either been approved for or requested a spot for. It is best practice to try an give as much notice as possible if you know you are no longer able to perform.

#### 1.2.1.4. Rating a venue
Once you have performed at an event, you are able to see the event in your past bookings and click a button allowing you to rate the event's venue out of 5. Please try to be fair with your rating and rate a venue based only on your experience of performing open mic comedy there.


### 1.2.2. As an event manager

#### 1.2.2.1. Creating a venue (tbc)

#### 1.2.2.2. Creating an event (tbc)

#### 1.2.2.3. Choose who performs at your event
On your *Manage my bookings* page, you will be able to see who's requested a spot at your event and whether they are pending your approval or you've already accepted them.

You are able to approve or refuse a request. You are also able to cancel someone you have previously approved for the event. It is advised that you excercise this power with caution as it is illadvisable to get a comedian' hopes up only to shatter them a moment later.

#### 1.2.2.4. Mark a performer as a "no-show"
If a performer booked to perform at your event doesn't arrive on the night, you are able to mark them as a "no-show" which will negatively affect their dependability rating and potentially make it harder for them to get booked in the future.

## 1.3. Project Status

### 1.3.1. /03/2021
Find Mike is the final project from a team on batch #476 of [Le Wagon's](https://www.lewagon.com/) part-time full-stack webdevelopment course. As such, we are presently not looking for other contributors and will continue developing the app as a team.

We would like to push it to production when we've got it to the point where it's ready for real world usage (and when lockdown ends).
